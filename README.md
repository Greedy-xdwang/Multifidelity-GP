# MFGP
Multi-fidelity  Gaussian Process

This is a probabilistic framework based on Gaussian process regression and nonlinear autoregressive schemes that is capable of learning complex nonlinear and space-dependent crosscorrelations between models of variable fidelity, and it can effectively safeguard against low-fidelity models that provide wrong trends. 

Codes reimplemented here is based on the idea from the following paper:

Nonlinear information fusion algorithms for data-efficient multi-fidelity modelling, P. Perdikaris, et al. Proc. R. Soc. A-17
